Heya all oldtimers still plying with glFTPd =)

I used PHP-Nuke back in the day for this site. Previously, I have updated it when I updated the server, so it worked with newer PHP
versions, but this time I hit a rock and frankly I can't be arsed to troubleshoot this anymore. I only find PHP-Nuke 8.3.2 (With support for PHP 5.3.
I have PHP 7 at least).

So I put all the script files here anyway, so you can access them at least.

Have fun!
