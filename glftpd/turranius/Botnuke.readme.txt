Ok, so you are getting "Failed to perform chroot()". 
This is the information Dark0n3 gave me, which helped me, and others
who had the same problem.

Edit /etc/group ( not /glftpd/etc/group ).
Find the Wheel group. If it is not there, it wont work.

Add the user who runs the bot there, as if it looked like:
wheel:x:10:root
change it to
wheel:x:10:root,UserWhoRunsTheBot

Then save it.

Now do
chown root:wheel /glftpd/bin/nuker
chmod 777 /glftpd/bin/nuker
chmod +s /glftpd/bin/nuker

And it should work. If it does not, check this link:

Basically, you need to make the binary run as root for the user running the bot.
