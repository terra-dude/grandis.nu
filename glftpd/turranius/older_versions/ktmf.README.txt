Welcome to KTMF. A multipurpose, rules follower script.

What does it do, in short?
It can do 6 things:
1: It can check for people dual downloading.
2: It can check for people uploading twice in the same dir.
3: It can check for people that is idling.
4: It can check for people that is downloading too slowly.
5: It can check for people that is uploading too slowly.
6: It can kick a user, a group or people with leech when there are a number
   of users on the site.

The above 6 are called different "modules" in the rest of this readme.

Ok, sounds nice. But there are other scripts out there that does the same, right. Well... read on, rape me later.
Note: All options specified below can be turned of or off as you desire, as well as full functions.
      That is, you can turn off, for instance, the Idle Kill function totally if you wish.

Excludes: 
There is a general exclude for users and/or groups that will be used in all parts as well
as excludes for the different modules. So for instance, you can have SiTEOPS generally
excluded from all parts, and Friends just excluded from the Slow Download kicker part.
Same thing goes for users.
Folders (pre folders) can be excluded, so it dosnt do anything if they are in them.

We will always kick the user for doing something that breaks the KTMF rules you set, but it can
do so much more to make their life miserable. WHAT it can do depends pretty much on which module
kicks the user;


Dual downloading:
Users and/or full groups can be excluded specifically for this function
It will verify, after a time set by you, that they are still dual downloading.
It can be set to not run unless there are a minimum number of people on the site.
It can put a temporary ban on the user. The time the user is banned is set by you.
With the tempban, it will also create a "bye" file for the user, so he sees why and
for how long he is banned, when he tries to log in.
It can take credits from a users for dual downloading.
It can take -1 logins for a user dual downloading.
it can remove -1 max_sim_down from a user dual downloading. If the user has unlimited 
max_sim_down, it will be set to 1.


Dual uploading:
Checks for people dual uploading in the same folder. It will not kick for uploading
to CD1 and CD2. That might be in later versions. For now, it only checks if he uploads
twice to CD1 for example. In short, uploading to different CD's in the same release is
ok. Uploading twice to the same one is not.
Users and/or full groups can be excluded specifically for this function
It has the same options as Dual downloading, except it can take 1 max_sim_up instead
of 1 max_sim_down.
This one will also see if the file still exists when the user is kicked, and if so, it
will delete it and there is an option to undupe the file too.


Idle Kick:
Users and/or full groups can be excluded specifically for this function.
It will verify, after a time set by you, that they are still idle.
You can set how many users must be on the site before it starts kicking them for idle, so
incase the site is getting full, it might be time to kick some 0days idlers or something.
Users can loose credits if they idle. This can be set so they only loose credits after they
have been idle for, say, 5 times in a row (you kick, they login, you kick, they login).
As with credits, users can also get tempbanned if they keep idling. Kicks in after a number
of concurrent times they have been idling. The tempban time can be specified ofcourse.
With tempban, a bye file will be created, telling the user why he is banned when he tries
to log in.


Slow Download:
Excludes, like the other functions.
Verify after a certain time, like the other functions.
You decide the speed limit, in kb/sec that they must be downloading at.
It can ban the user for a specified time if they download too slow. If not, it will just kick him.
A message will be shown to the user if he is tempbanned, when he tries to login again, telling him 
why and how slow he was leeching etc.


Slow Upload:
Like Slow Download, with the exceptions that it can only kick and tempban users.
I do not think anyone want to punish the users for it like with Slow Download.
Let me know if you do =)
This one will also see if the file still exists when the user is kicked, and if so, it
will delete it and there is an option to undupe the file too.


Generic Kick:
Quite simply, you enter a number of users and/or groups and it will kick those users/people
in those groups when the site is getting pretty full (number decided by you). It can also
kick and possibly tempban users based on them having RATIO 0 (leech). Usernames can be 
excluded (if they are part of a "kick" group), and it can also NOT kick them if they are
uploading at the moment.


It runs the modules in the order listed above, so it will first kick Dual Downloaders and
lastly kick from the Generic Kick module. I think thats a good order. This means that
if you set the userlimit to 18 users (out of 20 max or so) and the Slow Download module
kicks two and the Idle Kick module kicks another, the Generic Kick module will not kick
anyone, because there are no longer 18 users on site. 


Generics:
With all scripts, the logging to glftpd's logfile can be enabled/disabled.
Choose to send an early warning in the irc channel before he is actually kicked
(Good for dual downloading, not so good for idlers perhaps).

Test mode can be enabled. Script will do everything like normal, but will not actually
tempban/kick/remove credits/etc etc. Great for.. ehh, testing it, yeah.

Debug mode. Shows everything it does in the shell. Also good for testing. This is how you
should run it until you crontab it.

Showexclude. If debug is on, will also show you who it is going to exclude. Another 
testing thingie.

NOTE: Running it with the argument "test" will set all the above to TRUE temporarily.
Nice if you want to see if it still works, but are too lazy to change the script.


Installation:
Well, instead of using the normal sitewho, I edited the source for it a little. I only changed
the output from it so I could read it more easely. Rather cheesy, but it saved a couple of lines in the
script so.. I am including the source and the binary (compiled on Mandrake 8.1), incase you cant compile
it yourself, or simply trust me :)
If you are upgrading from 1.1.1 or earlier, you need the new tur-ftpwho included.

So..
If you wish to use my binary, copy everything but tur-ftpwho.c to /glftpd/bin or where ever you have it
located on your system. 
If you dont want to use my binary, unpack tur-ftpwho.c and: gcc -o /glftpd/bin/tur-ftpwho tur-ftpwho.c
If you run glftpd at another ipc_key, check the first line in the source before compiling it.

Copy kfmt.sh and ktmf.conf to /glftpd/bin, or anywhere really. If ktmf.conf is not in /glftpd/bin then
change to path to it in ktmf.sh.

Make ktmf.sh and tur-ftpwho executable. Try and run tur-ftpwho and marvel at the lovely output it makes. hehe.

Edit ktmf.conf and change the settings as you please. They are fairly documented already, but I'll give it another
go, just cause I'm so bloody nice, and want to bore you. Make sure you read it all, mauahhaha!


WHOBIN=       Full path to where you put tur-ftpwho. 

GLLOG=        Full path to the file you wish your bot announces to. Usually /glftpd/ftp-data/glftpd.log.
            
LOG=          KTMF's own logfile where all the kicks/bans/whatever are logged to. Set to "" to disable
              logging. Do NOT set to glftpd.log as this is in another format.

GLROOT=       The root dir of glftpd. Usually just /glftpd unless its in a jailed dir or similar.

USERFOLDER=   Full path ( from / ) to the folder where your users are located.

TEMPATH=      KTMF needs to store temp files to keep track of how many times a user has idled etc.
              This is the path to that folder.

BYEFOLDER=    Full path to glftpd's byefolder. I will store a message for the user in there if he 
              should get tempbanned.

KILLGHOST=    KTMF runs killghost before checking each function (3 times if they are all enabled).
              This is so incase someone gets kicked for dual downloading, the chance that one of 
              them was a ghost is minimal.
              Set it to what you would type in the shell to kick ghosts, or set it it "" to turn
              off this function totally.
              If you have this one and ktmf is crontabbed, you do not need any normal crontabs 
              for killghost since ktmf will do it.

UNDUPE=       Full path to the binary "undupe" that comes with glftpd. This is used for the Dual
              upload module and the Slow Upload module. To disable unduping, set this one to ""
              Note that good zipscripts will automatically delete a file and undupe it when we kick
              a user, but some zipscripts apparently dont, leaving us with a incomplete file and/or
              a duped file. Thats why we have this option. It dosnt hurt to have it set, even though
              your zipscript does the work for you.

UNDUPEUSER=   If above is not "", which user should do the undupe? This user must exist and have
              the flag "C". Default is "glftpd", but that user does not have the C flag per default.

LOCKFILE=     Full path to a file that will be used to lock the script. Incase the script is running
              and you run it again, it will not run. This is mostly a safety feature. 
              Please note though, if a user is tempbanned, and you happen to run the script again,
              they will not be deleted again. Userfiles should not get corrupted just cause you 
              happened to run it when it was already runnning. So, no biggie.
              You can set this one to "" if you REALLY dont like lockfiles. You can run it whenever
              you like then. If you have long temp-ban periods, you should set this to "".

FOLDEREX=     If you have folders in your users dir, add them here, | separated.
              Not a big deal but it will remove some error messages that will pop up
              otherwise if you have GEXCLUDEON to TRUE.

PREFOLDERS=   A set of folders that users will not be checked in. Could be pre folders or something.
              If you dont want users to be kicked from, for instance, /site/GROUPS, then add that
              here. This function is new is ktmf 1.2 and requires the new tur-ftpwho that comes with
              it. 
              If all your pre folders are called the same, IE "GROUPS", then add that one so
              its PREFOLDERS="GROUPS". It works too.
              It is case sensitive.
              Put one folder on each line, and dont break the " " structure. 
              Set this one to "" if you want to disable the function entirely.

EXCLUDE=      Usernames to exclude from all parts of this script. Separate them with a '|'.
              (Without the '').

GEXCLUDEON=   TRUE/FALSE. Shall we use group excludes at all in the script? If you are only going to
              use usernames to exclude on, I recomend you set this to FALSE. It takes a little while
              extra to check and build the exclude list if this is TRUE, but its a powerful feature.
              Note: Since version 3.0, this hardly takes long anymore. I am keeping this here anyway
              for those who wish to save an extra second or so =)
              ( And I'm too lazy to remove it =) )

GEXCLUDE=     Groups, separated by a |, that you wish to totally exclude from all parts of this
              script. Only works if GEXCLUDEON is TRUE.

PREEXCLUDE=   This is not like PREFOLDERS above. Here is where you define all your dirs containing
              predirs. It will look at the foldernames and automatically exclude every user in that
              group from all sections in this script. With this, every affil are totally excluded.
              With PREFOLDERS above, they are only excluded IF they are in their predirs.
              If you set this one so it excludes all your affils, PREFOLDERS does not do anything.
              Use full path to the predirs ( /glftpd/site/... ). Seperate predirs with a space (new line).
              Set it to "" to disable (default).
              For instance, if you set this to /glftpd/site/DiVX/GROUPS, and you have 2 folders in 
              there, say, BP and EPiSODE, then every user in the groups BP and EPiSODE will be 
              excluded from all parts of KTMF.


There. Thats the default setup. Now on to the different modules!


Dual Downloading section:

DUALDL=          TRUE/FALSE. Do you want Dual download checking at all? If not, set it to FALSE

DELAYDUALDL=     Time in seconds to wait before verifying that those users it found dual downloading
                 are still dual downloading. 10-30 seconds is a good value I think. Gives them time
                 to download nfo's etc, but no big files.

LIMITTODUALKICK= Minumum number of users that must be on the site before starting to check for
                 users dual downloading. Set to 1 to always check.

CREDITLOSSDD=    TRUE/FALSE. Should the user loose credits when it finds him dual downloading?

CREDITLOSSDDMB=  If he should loose credits, how much, in MB, should he loose.

TAKE1LOGIN=      TRUE/FALSE. If this is enabled, it will remove 1 login from the user. So, 
                 if the user could log on twice before, he will now only be able to login once.
                 If its 20, it will be 19. You get the point.
                 KTMF will never set it to a value lower then 1.

TAKE1DL=         TRUE/FALSE. If this is enabled, the user will loose one of his download slots.
                 He can still log on as many times as before, but he wont be able to download
                 with as many threads. Changes max_sim_down.
                 Note: If the user has -1 max_sim_down (unlimited), it will be set to 1 instead.
                 KTMF will never set it to a value lower then 1.

DUALBAN=         TRUE/FALSE. Shall we put a temporary ban on users found dual downloading?
                 NOTE: If the user is dual downloading AND doing something else on site, only
                 the two sessions that dual downloads will be banned, and the user gets the 6
                 flag. This means he can still do stuff with the 3rd login, but should he log
                 out with that one, he can not log in again until the tempban time below has 
                 passed.

DUALBANTIME=     If above is TRUE, for how long, in seconds, should it wait before releasing the
                 ban?

BOTDUALDL=       TRUE/FALSE. Should the kicking of a user be writted to the logfile, and therefor
                 easely picked up by your botscript? NOTE: As with v3.0, you can also turn this 
                 off in the botscript. If you want it to announce, both this and the bot output
                 must be enabled. See sitebot settings below for more info.

BOTDUALDLW=      When it first finds a user dual downloading, before verifying it, should we give
                 the user an early warning?

DUALEXCLUDE=     Usernames to exclude from the Dual Download checking only. If you have a user in the 
                 generic EXCLUDE at the top, there is no reason to put him here. 
                 Separate users with a |

DUALGEXCLUDE=    Groups to exclude from the Dual Download checking only. As above, no point in putting
                 groups here, if they already in the GEXCLUDE part at the top.
                 Separate groups with a |


Dual Uploading section:

DUALUP=          TRUE/FALSE. Do you want Dual upload checking at all? If not, set it to FALSE

DELAYDUALUP=     Time in seconds to wait before verifying that those users it found dual uploading
                 are still dual uploading. 10-30 seconds is a good value I think. Gives them time
                 to download nfo's etc, but no big files. The faster your line is, the less you would
                 set this too I guess.

LIMITTODUALUPKICK= Minumum number of users that must be on the site before starting to check for
                   users dual uploading. Set to 1 to always check.

CREDITLOSSDU=    TRUE/FALSE. Should the user loose credits when it finds him dual uploading?

CREDITLOSSDUMB=  If he should loose credits, how much, in MB, should he loose (heh, it says DUMB).

TAKE1LOGINDU=    TRUE/FALSE. If this is enabled, it will remove 1 login from the user. So, 
                 if the user could log on twice before, he will now only be able to login once.
                 KTMF will never set it to a value lower then 1.

TAKE1UP=         TRUE/FALSE. If this is enabled, the user will loose one of his upload slots.
                 He can still log on as many times as before, but he wont be able to upload
                 with as many threads. Changes max_sim_up.
                 Note: If the user has -1 max_sim_up (unlimited), it will be set to 1 instead.
                 KTMF will never set it to a value lower then 1.

BANDUALUP=       TRUE/FALSE. Shall we put a temporary ban on users found dual uploading?

DUALUPBANTIME=   If above is TRUE, for how long, in seconds, should it wait before releasing the
                 ban?

BOTDUALUP=       TRUE/FALSE. Should the kicking of a user be writted to the logfile, and therefor
                 easely picked up by your botscript?

BOTDUALUPW=      When it first finds a user dual uploading, before verifying it, should we give
                 the user an early warning (write it to the logfile, like above) ?

DUALUPEXCLUDE=   Usernames to exclude from the Dual uploading checking only. If you have a user in the 
                 generic EXCLUDE at the top, there is no reason to put him here. 
                 Separate users with a |

DUALUPGEXCLUDE=  Groups to exclude from the Dual uploading checking only. As above, no point in putting
                 groups here, if they already in the GEXCLUDE part at the top.
                 Separate groups with a |


Idle Kill section:

IDLEKILL=        TRUE/FALSE. Do you want to check for users idling at all? If not, set it to FALSE.

DELAYIDLEKILL=   Time in seconds to wait before checking that they are indeed idling.

LIMITTOIDLEKICK= Number of users that must be on the site for the Idle Kill to kick in at all.
                 If you set this to 10, and there are only 5 people online, nobody will get kicked
                 for idling. If you dont like this function, set it to 1 and it will always kick em.

CREDITLOSSIK=    TRUE/FALSE. Should users loose credits for being idle? They will always be kicked
                 regardless, but this gives them an extra punch in the balls.

TIMESBEFOREBANI= How many concurrent times must this script have found him idleing, before it 
                 starts taking credits? The higher you set this, the higher the chance that this 
                 script will run at the same time as his ftp client gives the anti-idle command,
                 and KTMF wont think he idles anymore, and reset the counter.
                 In other words, it is not 100% that KTMF will find him idling. There is a 2
                 second window from the user issuing a anti-idle command until KTMF sees him
                 as idle again.

CREDITSLOSSIKMB= If you set it to take credits from users, how much should they loose, in MB ?

BANIDLE=         TRUE/FALSE. Put a tempban on uses who idle too friggin much? 

TIMESTOBAN=      How many concurrent times must KTMF have found him idling before temp banning him?
                 Set to "0" to do it on the first occurance. See TIMESBEFOREBANI above.

IDLEBANTIME=     If/When he DOES get banned, how long should it last, in seconds?

BOTIDLE=         TRUE/FALSE. Announce kick to the logfile so your bot can pick it up?

BOTIDLEW=        TRUE/FALSE. Announce an early warning for people idling. Not the best idea I guess :)

IDLEEXCLUDE=     Usernames to exclude from the Idle Kill function only. If the user is in the EXCLUDE
                 part at the top, there is no need to put him in here. Separete with |

IDLEGEXCLUDE=    Groups to exclude from Idle killing. Like with users, if they are excluded with
                 GEXCLUDE, dont put them in here. Well, you can, but there is no purpose :)
                 Only works if GEXCLUDEON is TRUE at the top of the script.
                 Separate groups with a |


Slow Download section:

SLOWDLKICK=      TRUE/FALSE. Totally turn on or off the Slow download checking.

DELAYSLOWDL=     Time in seconds to wait before verifying that a user is still downloading too slow.

SPEEDLIMIT=      The speedlimit, in kb/sec, that the user must download HIGHER then, to not get kicked.
                 Do not use dots or so, just a clean old number.

LIMITTOKICK=     How many users must be online before we start kicking people? If you set this to 10 and
                 there are 9 people on, users can download how fricking slow they want. Set it to 1 to 
                 always kick em.

BAN=             TRUE/FALSE. Put a tempban on users downloading too slowly?
                 NOTE: As with v3.0, we no longer kick ALL pids for the user that is
                 downloading too slowly. Only the pids that IS downloading too slowly.
                 So, if he is downloading too slow in one process, and uploading somewhere else, only
                 the slow downloading pid will be kicked (yes, this is a good thing).

BANTIME=         If they get a tempban, how many seconds before we relase the ban?

BOTSLOW=         TRUE/FALSE. Announce kicks to the logfile so your bot can pick it up. Great joy
                 when everyone laughs at the lamers with the slow lines :)

BOTSLOWW=        TRUE/FALSE. Announce an early alert on users it finds? This happens when it finds
                 a user downloading too slow, but before the delay til verify kicks in.

SLOWEXLCUDE=     Usernames to exclude from the Slow Download function only. If the user is already in 
                 EXCLUDE at the top, there is no need to put him in here. This is for slow downloading
                 only. Separate users with a |

SLOWGEXCLUDE=    Groups to exclude from the Slow Download function only. Like above, if they are already
                 in GEXCLUDE, there is no need for them to be here. Separate them with a |


Slow Upload section:

SLOWULKICK=      TRUE/FALSE. Totally turn on or off the Slow upload checking.

DELAYSLOWUL=     Time in seconds to wait before verifying that a user is still uploading too slow.

SPEEDLIMITUL=    The speedlimit, in kb/sec, that the user must upload HIGHER then, to not get kicked.
                 Do not use dots or so, just a clean old number.

LIMITTOKICKUL=   How many users must be online before we start kicking people? If you set this to 10 and
                 there are 9 people on, users can upload how fricking slow they want. Set it to 1 to 
                 always kick slow uploaders.

BANUL=           TRUE/FALSE. Put a tempban on users uploading too slowly?

BANTIMEUL=       If they get a tempban, how many seconds before we relase the ban?

BOTSLOWUL=       TRUE/FALSE. Announce kicks to the logfile so your bot can pick it up. Great joy
                 when everyone laughs at the lamers with the lame source sites =)

BOTSLOWWUL=      TRUE/FALSE. Announce an early alert on users it finds? This happens when it finds
                 a user uploading too slow, but before the delay til verify kicks in.

SLOWEXLCUDEUL=   Usernames to exclude from the Slow Uploading function only. If the user is already in 
                 EXCLUDE at the top, there is no need to put him in here. This is for slow uploading
                 only. Separate users with a |

SLOWGEXCLUDEUL=  Groups to exclude from the Slow Upload function only. Like above, if they are already
                 in GEXCLUDE, there is no need for them to be here. Separate them with a |


Generic Kicker Section:

GENKICK=         TRUE/FALSE. Totally turn on or off this function.

LIMITTOGENKICK=  How many users must be on online before we start kicking?

TEMPBANLEECH=    TRUE/FALSE. Put a temporary ban on the user before we kick their asses outta here?

TEMPBANTIME=     How many seconds should the tempban last, if its TRUE above.

RATIO0KICK=      TRUE/FALSE. Kick users with leech (RATIO 0)?

UPEXCLUDE=       TRUE/FALSE. If they are uploading, do not kick them.

KICKUSERS=	 Users to kick, | seperated.

KICKGROUPS=      Users in these groups will be kicked if they are online when the LIMITTOGENKICK
                 is reached, | Seperated.

GENEXCLUDE=      If for some reason you wish to exclude a user, do it here. | Seperated.

BOTGEN=		 TRUE/FALSE. Announce kick to glftpd's logfile? (No, there is no early warning
                 for this one.)


Others:

DEBUG=           TRUE/FALSE. This will output what it does in the shell. Recomend you have this one
                 on (and bot announces to FALSE) when you test the script). 

TEST=            TEST/FALSE. Another feature so you can test it without giving your whole site a tempban. 
                 With this on TRUE, it will NOT kick/ban/take creds,whatever. It will just pretend it 
                 does.

SHOWEXCLUDES=    If you run DEBUG on TRUE, then it will also display all the users, for each function, that
                 it is going to exclude. For testing or for fun.



-[ Getting it to talk in irc ]-
Now then, I only have instructions for Dark0n3s Zipscript-c. If anyone want to paste me a working
setup for another sitebot, please do and I'll add it here with your creds.

Edit dZSbot.tcl. 

Add to 'set msgtypes(DEFAULT)'
 KTMFDLW KTMFDL KTMFULW KTMFUL KTMFIDW KTMFID KTMFSLDW KTMFSLD KTMFSLUW KTMFSLU KTMFG

Add below the existing 'set chanlist'
 set chanlist(KTMFDLW)  "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFDL)   "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFULW)  "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFIDW)  "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFID)   "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFSLDW) "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFSLD)  "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFSLUW) "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFSLU)  "#SiteChan"
 set chanlist(KTMFG)    "#SiteChan"
Of course, change SiteChan to your sitechan name =)

Add below the existing 'set disable('
 set disable(KTMFDLW)         0
 set disable(KTMFDL)          0
 set disable(KTMFULW)         0
 set disable(KTMFUL)          0
 set disable(KTMFIDW)         0
 set disable(KTMFID)          0
 set disable(KTMFSLDW)        0
 set disable(KTMFSLD)         0
 set disable(KTMFSLUW)        0
 set disable(KTMFSLU)         0
 set disable(KTMFG)           0

Add below the existing 'set variables'
 set variables(KTMFDLW)     "%user %delay"
 set variables(KTMFDL)      "%user"
 set variables(KTMFULW)     "%user %where %delay"
 set variables(KTMFUL)      "%user %where"
 set variables(KTMFIDW)     "%user %delay"
 set variables(KTMFID)      "%user"
 set variables(KTMFSLDW)    "%user %speed %delay"
 set variables(KTMFSLD)     "%user %speed"
 set variables(KTMFSLUW)    "%user %speed %delay"
 set variables(KTMFSLU)     "%user %speed"
 set variables(KTMFG)       "%users"

Add below the existing 'set announce('

set announce(KTMFDLW)      "%bold-\[DualDL\]-%bold %user early warning for dual download. Checking again in %delay seconds."
set announce(KTMFDL)       "%bold-\[DualDL\]-%bold %user kicked for dual downloading."
set announce(KTMFULW)      "%bold-\[DualUL\]-%bold %user early warning for dual upload in %where. Checking again in %delay seconds."
set announce(KTMFUL)       "%bold-\[DualUL\]-%bold %user kicked for dual upload in %where."
set announce(KTMFIDW)      "%bold-\[IdleKick\]-%bold %user early warning for idling. Checking again in %delay seconds."
set announce(KTMFID)       "%bold-\[IdleKick\]-%bold %user kicked for idling."
set announce(KTMFSLDW)     "%bold-\[SlowDownload\]-%bold %user early warning for slow dowload at %speed k/sec. Checking again in %delay seconds."
set announce(KTMFSLD)      "%bold-\[SlowDownload\]-%bold %user kicked for slow download at %speed k/sec."
set announce(KTMFSLUW)     "%bold-\[SlowUpload\]-%bold %user early warning for slow upload at %speed k/sec. Checking again in %delay seconds."
set announce(KTMFSLU)      "%bold-\[SlowUpload\]-%bold %user kicked for slow upload at %speed k/sec."
set announce(KTMFG)        "%bold-\[GenKick\]-%bold %users poofs as a race kicks in."


Thats pretty much it. Change the text in the announces as you like. Dont forget to rehash the bot.

NOTE: Announcers for the different modules can be turned off in 2 ways. The first is to set
any of the 'set disable(' to 1 and it will not announce it.
The other is in the script itself, as you must have read before. For Dual Dowload for instance, its
 BOTDUALDL="TRUE"         # Announce kick in logfile? TRUE/FALSE
 BOTDUALDLW="TRUE"        # Announce early warning on kick in logfile? TRUE/FALSE
These must be TRUE for it to even write it to the logfile. 
For it to announce, it must be TRUE in the script, and "set disable" must be 0 in dZSbot.tcl.

Explanation of the triggers:
KTMFDLW  = Dual Download early warning.
KTMFDL   = Dual Download actual kick.
KTMFULW  = Dual Uploading to the same release, early warning.
KTMFUL   = Dual uploading to the same release, actual kick.
KTMFIDW  = Early warning for Idle kick. (You probably want this off.)
KTMFID   = Idle kick. Actual kick. (You probably want this off too.)
KTMFSLDW = Slow Download, early warning.
KTMFSLD) = Slow Download, actual kick.
KTMFSLUW = Slow Upload, early warning.
KTMFSLU  = Slow Upload, actual kick.
KTMFG    = Users kicked from Generic Kicker (this has no early warning).


-[ Autorun it ]-

Crontab the script to run as often as you like, as root. Something like
*/2 * * * * /glftpd/bin/ktmf.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
will make it run every 2 minutes.

( The ">/dev/null 2>&1" part is needed. If there are no users on site when it runs, then
  tur-ftpwho will give an error and that will be mailed to you if you dont use the pipe. )

-[ Bla bla text }-

You can run ktmf with 'ktmf.sh test' and it will temporarily set DEBUG, TEST and SHOWEXCLUDES to TRUE 
no matter how they are set in the script. Used for testing it from shell but without having to 
change those to TRUE manually in the script.

Questions, bug reports or suggestions? Message Turranius on Efnet (Turranius/Turran/Turr|away/Turr|work).
I usually hang out in #glftpd. You can also email to turranius@hotmail.com
