# v-1.07 22 Mar 12 (11:38:52)
# I got tired of not being able to find a rule script that worked 100% how I wanted
# so I finally stumbled around in TCL and wrote this for myself.  This is my second
# attempt ever to write TCL, so any comments are appreciated.  I can usually be found
# on efnet in #pzs-ng.  -Genocaust
#
# Version history:
#    1.05: Initial public release
#    1.06: Fixed a small error in displaying available sections
#    1.07: Hardcoded the errormessage for invalid sections; one less thing people need to configure now
#
# rulespath - Where the script should look for your section rules files, they need to have a .rules extention
# sections  - What sections you would like to list rules for, case insensitive
