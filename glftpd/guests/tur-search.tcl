#                                                                           #
# Tur-Search.
# Two small scripts that allow users to do like 'site search' from glftpd   #
# and !search from irc.                                                     #
#                                                                           #
# Yes, glftpd already supports 'site search' but this one has a few tricks. #
# It shows if the release exists on the site still (might be in dirlog but  #
# not on site) and if so, the total size of it.                             #
#                                                                           #
# It also has the ability to create symlinks to each release it finds in a  #
# place you decide, so if the user wants to download a lot of stuff, he/she #
# does not have to read the text and manually enter all dirs. Just tag all  #
# the symlinks and off we go.                                               #
#                                                                           #
# Combine this with Tur-DirLogClean to keep the dirlog nicely updated!!     #
#                                                                           #

#                                                                           #
# Put tur-search in /glftpd/bin                                             #
#                                                                           #
# Put tur-search.tcl in your bots scripts folder and load it in the bots    #
# config file. Rehash the bot and make sure it says that its loading it.    #
#                                                                           #
# Make tur-search.sh executable with chmod 755 tur-search.sh                #
#                                                                           #
# Change the settings below:                                                #
#                                                                           #
# glroot=     The path to your glftpd dir. Usually just /glftpd             #
# dirlog=     The path to your dirlog file, seen from glroot above.         #
#                                                                           #
# stringsirc= The path to the strings binary. This is the strings that will #
#             be executed from irc and/or shell, so use 'which strings' to  #
#             find it and put the path to it here.                          #
#                                                                           #
# stringsgl=  This is the strings binary that will be used when inside      #
#             glftpd.                                                       #
#                                                                           #
#             Now, if you plan to keep using glftpds internal 'site search' #
#             there is no use to set this.                                  #
#             Otherwise, you will need to copy the strings binary to your   #
#             /glftpd/bin dir.                                              #
#             Note that strings require a few libraries. To test which ones #
#             do 'ldd /path/to/strings' from shell. It will show you which  #
#             libraries it needs. Copy all of them to /glftpd/lib.          #
#                                                                           #
#             To test if it works, do this:                                 #
#             chroot /glftpd                                                #
#             cd bin                                                        #
#             ./strings /ftp-data/logs/dirlog                               #
#             It should now spit out a lot of lines containing directories  #
#             and most likely a few lines containing crap (thats ok).       #
#                                                                           #
# maxhitsirc= Maximum number of hits to return when running from irc/shell. #
# maxhitsgl=  Maximum number of hits to return when running from glftpd.    #
#                                                                           #
# minlenght=  Minimum lenght to search for when only searching using one    #
#             argument. Set to "" to disable (not recomended).              #
#                                                                           #
# ignoredirs= Ignore these words in search. Good to add the name of the pre #
#             dirs here. Use /PRE to prevent anything starting with PRE to  #
#             be displayed. Use /PRE/ to match the exact foldername.        #
#             Predirs should not be in the dirlog anyway, but better safe.. #
#             Seperate ignores with a |  ( '/GROUPS/|Animalporn|ost' )      #
#             Any weird chars should be marked with \, ie \[inco            #
#                                                                           #
#             Use a . to define * , ie: CD.                                 #
#             Those familiar with grep can of course use CD[1-9] as well.   #
#                                                                           #
# showsize=   If this is TRUE, it will run 'du -ms' on the dir it finds and #
#             reports its size in MB for every hit.                         #
#                                                                           #
# sitedir=    If the above is TRUE, what is your sitedir? /site as          #
#             default. When doing a search, check the path. This is what    #
#             needs to be before the path for 'du' to find it.              #
#                                                                           #
# symsdir=    If you have it loaded as 'site search' in glftpd and want the #
#             users to be able to create symlinks to their findings, set    #
#             this to a directory inside your /site structure somewhere.    #
#             Once a user specifies --create in their search string, it     #
#             will create a directory with their name in here and put a     #
#             symlink to each hit they get. This is why it only works from  #
#             glftpd. We have to sort them somehow and the username is the  #
#             easiest way. Cant have everyone create symlinks in the same   #
#             directory or it would get ... messy.                          #
#                                                                           #
#             Before starting the search, their own "symlinkdir" will be    #
#             cleaned out, using the unlink binary.                         #
#                                                                           #
#             While the symlinks are cleaned out when the user does a new   #
#             search (if they do not use --noclear as well), their dir is   #
#             not. If might therefor be a nice idea to clear out the        #
#             symsdir once a day or similar.                                #
#             A simple crontab can take care of that. Something like:       #
#             0 0 * * * rm -rf /path/to/symsdir/* >/dev/null 2>&1           #
#             should do fine.                                               #
#                                                                           #
#             Oh yeah, create this dir in shell and set chmod 777 on it.    #
#                                                                           #
#                                                                           #
# Now then, if you wanted to replace it with your current 'site search'     #
# command in glftpd, add this to glftpd.conf:                               #
# site_cmd search EXEC /bin/tur-search.sh                                   #
# custom-search *                                                           #
# Of course, you could also use a different name for it. Just replace       #
# search with whatever you want to call it with.                            #
#                                                                           #
# Important: This script requires the 'unlink' binary to be present in      #
# /glftpd/bin if you want to load it as 'site search' in glftpd and have    #
# symsdir set. I dont trust rm -f to not remove the actual release.         #
# It also requires some standard ones like:                                 #
# grep, egrep, cut, tr, du, sed & tail                                      #
#                                                                           #
# Run tur-search.sh from shell and make sure it works.                      #
# When you test it from the bot you might get an error like "permission     #
# denied /root/.bashrc".                                                    #
# Check the (general) FAQ on the website on how to fix that.                #
#                                                                           #
# For instructions in both irc and glftpd, just run it without any args.    #
#                                                                           #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Note to people wondering what the frell I am doing in the for each line.. #
# There is some crap in the dirlog. If you do 'strings dirlog' you will see #
# it. What I do is look for the word 'site' and start there. Then end the   #
# line before the filename. Crude, but it works.                            #

# 2.1   : When checking diskusage (if showsize=true) and it hit a nuked dir #
#         you got a permission denied error - fixed.                        #
#                                                                           #
#         If it hit an entry in the dirlog with a tab in it, it would halt  #
#         - fixed.                                                          #
#-                                                                         -#
# 2.0   : Pretty much rewritten from scratch.                               #
#                                                                           #
#         * Renamed from tur-botsearch to tur-search since it now works     #
#           from inside glftpd as well.                                     #
#                                                                           #
#         * Changed how the search works. You can now specify how many      #
#           arguments as you want to search. It should also be quite a bit  #
#           faster.                                                         #
#           The drawback to this is that the order of the words must match  #
#           the order they appear in the release.                           #
#           I guess some people see this as a good thing, as long as you    #
#           know about it.                                                  #
#           Its described in the help for the script.                       #
#                                                                           #
#         * Added a neat option. If you load this as 'site search' in       #
#           glftpd, you can have it create symlinks to each result it gets  #
#           into a predefined directory. This is GREAT when searcing for    #
#           lots of stuff you want to download as the user can just go into #
#           the symlinkdir and tag the releases for download without having #
#           to manually enter each dir, go one step up and then download    #
#           it one by one.                                                  #
#                                                                           #
#           Make sure you read through the installation instructions again  #
#           as it changed quite a bit as well as running it without args    #
#           to get usage instructions on --create and --noclear             #
#                                                                           #
#           The above idea was suggested by m0n. Good one =)                #
#                                                                           #
# People upgrading from old tur-botsearch will need to replace the tcl as   #
# well. Notice that its tur-search.tcl instead of tur-botsearch.tcl so edit #

# 1.4   : Will work with releases and sections with spaces in them now.     #
#         Will use ~ as a tempchar for space, so if you have dirs with ~ in #
#         them, they will be a space in search. Just search for '~' and     #
#         change that to some other char you dont use if you dont like it.  #

#         This will return MB value of release. If it is not found, it will #
