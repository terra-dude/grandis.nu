So, you dont want the script to announce in all chans?

By default it announces in the chan where you execute the script. If you only want it to
announce to a specific chan, there are two ways we can accomplish this.

The first is to hardcode which chan it send stuff to. This, I guess, is not what you want
because if I execute the command in #chan1, and we hardcoded it to #chan2, it will
still show the output, just in the other chan.. not good. It should be quiet then.
Anyway, to accomplish the above, change this line:

putquick "PRIVMSG $chan :$line"
to
putquick "PRIVMSG #sitechan :$line"

putquick might be puthelp or whatever.. dosnt matter. Replace #sitechan with your chan name.
Dont forget to rehash the bot whenever you change anything in the .tcl.

For the other solution, where it stayes quiet, change so that if it looked like this before:

proc pub:turfreecheck {nick uhost handle chan arg} {
 set binary {/glftpd/bin/tur-free.sh}
 set section [lindex $arg 0]
 foreach line [split [exec $binary $section] "\n"] {
    putquick "PRIVMSG $chan :$line"
 }
}

Change it to:

proc pub:turfreecheck {nick uhost handle chan arg} {
 if {$chan == "#sitechan"} {
   set binary {/glftpd/bin/tur-free.sh}
   set section [lindex $arg 0]
   foreach line [split [exec $binary $section] "\n"] {
      putquick "PRIVMSG $chan :$line"
   }
 }
}

If it dosnt announce anywhere, add 
putquick "PRIVMSG $chan :$chan"
above the  if {$chan == "#sitechan"} {

It will then announce what chan it thinks its in and what you should specify as #sitechan.
Its usually the correct name, just lowercase. Its case sensitive, which is you usually specify
the "wrong" channame =)
